            <h3>MY LEARNING HIGHLIGHTS IN THE SUBJECT</h3>
            <p>The toughest part of this subject isn't really one particular lesson, but this big project our instructor assigns. We're given a problem to solve using all the stuff we've learned, and we've got a deadline to finish it. It's a real challenge because we have to think super hard about how to use what we've been taught in class to crack the problem.</p>
            <p>See, the thing is, it's not just about remembering the lessons. We've got to figure out how to apply them to solve this real-life problem. Sometimes it feels tough because it's not just following steps we've learned, but really understanding them and being creative in how we use them. But you know what? Even though it's tough, it's kind of cool too. It's like a puzzle, and when we finally figure it out and make things work, it feels awesome!</p>

            <p>I learned that in almost every problem solving methodology the first step is defining or identifying the problem. A careful analysis of that need should involve both prospective users of the information (a user who seeks or may seek to enter into a contract for an additional service) and one or more trained system designers or programmers who can perceive the full nature of the need (how the computer can be used to respond to the need).</p>

            <p>When I was learning the basics of C programming, I started by understanding how C programs were built and grasped concepts like different types of data, storing information in variables, and making choices in a program. I also learned about functions, which were like tasks, arrays that held multiple items, and pointers that helped with handling computer memory. Next, I learned about working with files, managing memory while the program ran, and fixing mistakes that might happen. Later on, I explored more advanced things like doing special operations with data and using pre-made sets of tools.
              I knew that practicing a lot by doing exercises and creating things would help me become better at using C. It was pretty cool learning how to tell the computer what to do using this programming language!

          <h4>SELECTION STRUCTURES IN C.</h4>
          <div class="text">
            <img src="./assets/outputm3.png" alt="" width="400px" height="200px">
            <p>When I was learning about selection structures in C programming, I focused on two main types: the "if" statement and the "switch" statement. The "if" statement allowed me to make decisions in the program based on certain conditions. I learned how to write conditions using relational and logical operators to determine which code blocks should be executed. For instance, I used "if" statements to perform specific actions if a condition was true or false.
              Additionally, I explored the "switch" statement, which provided an efficient way to select among multiple options based on the value of a variable. This construct allowed me to compare a variable against different cases and execute code blocks depending on the matched case.

          <h4>ITERATIVE STATEMENTS IN C.</h4>
          <div class="text">
            <img src="./assets/outputm4.png" alt="" width="400px" height="200px">
            <p>During my learning, I explored iterative statements in Câ€”specifically, the "for," "while," and "do-while" loops. The "for" loop allowed repetitive execution of a code block for a set number of times, offering control through initialization, condition checking, and iteration steps. I found the "while" loop beneficial for executing code based on changing conditions.
              Moreover, I delved into the "do-while" loop, ensuring the execution of the code block at least once by assessing the condition after the initial iteration. This feature proved handy for situations requiring an action before checking if the condition for continuation was met. These iterative statements became pivotal tools, enhancing the efficiency and functionality of my C programs.
